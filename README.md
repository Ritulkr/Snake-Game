# Snake Game

A classic Snake game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Introduction

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game where the player controls a snake that grows in length as it eats food. The objective is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the snake's own body or the game boundaries.

## Features

- Snake movement controlled by arrow keys
- Food generation and scoring system
- Game over when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries
- Optional feature: Snake wraps around the screen borders instead of ending the game
